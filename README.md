# Dog-Breed-Classifier
A Deep Learning Model trained using a custom Convolutional Neural Network to predict wheather a dog is present in an image.
If the model predicts a dog in the the image it will further classify its breed from around 133 breeds fed into the network.
Whereas, if a human is detected in the image, the model will predict a dog's breed that closely resembles that human face.
