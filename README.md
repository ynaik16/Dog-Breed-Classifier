# Dog-Breed-Classifier
A Deep Learning Model trained using a custom Convolutional Neural Network to predict wheather a dog is present in an image.
If the model predicts a dog in the the image it will further classify its breed from around 133 breeds fed into the network.
Whereas, if a human is detected in the image, the model will predict a dog's breed that closely resembles that human face.

This is Convolutional Neural Networks or CNN project. This project is part of Udacityâ€™s Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree program. This Machine Learning program can detect a human face and also identify the breed of a dog, given a picture. If, however, only a human face is detected, it gives an estimate of the dog breed that most resembles the face. This project is based upon a Deep Learning Model which utilizes Convolutional Neural Network to distinguish between 133 breeds of dogs and make predictions with a test accuracy of 86% given a set of images.
